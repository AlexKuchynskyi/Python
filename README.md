# Python
Includes different Python scripts.  
[Animals_API](https://github.com/AlexKuchynskyi/Python/blob/master/animals_api.py) script performs ETL process - reliably loads (GET) every animal from the API endpoint, makes some transformations - translation comma-delimited string to an array, translation Javascript timestamps into ISO8601 timestamps in UTC - and then POST transformed data to another endpoint.  
[Count_query](https://github.com/AlexKuchynskyi/Python/blob/master/Count_queries.py) program counts how many times each query of Y can be found among the elements of X.  
[Mr_Mrs](https://github.com/AlexKuchynskyi/Python/blob/master/Mr_Mrs.py) program gets integer N and N strings in specific format and returns sorted by age list with prefixes "Mr." and "Mrs."  
[Post_time](https://github.com/AlexKuchynskyi/Python) program  looks for the times that a Facebook user posted.  
[Szondi_test](https://github.com/AlexKuchynskyi/Python/blob/master/Sondi_05_02_graph.py) program provides psychological testing by Szondi method. (There some additional requirement for it. Watch file header.)
